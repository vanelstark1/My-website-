        <h2>PROGRAM NAME:</h2>
        <p> BSC. BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING </p>
       
        <h3>REASON FOR STUDYING THE COURSE</h3>
       
        <p>I offer Bsc. Biomedical Engineering at the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and technology.
            I initially wanted to offer medicine, but I always had this crazy interest in technology. 
            After conducting research I found a course that combined my love for technology and biology and that was BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING.
            <div>I'm taking biomedical engineering because I want to make a difference in the medical field. Integrtaing technology into medicine. 
             I'm taking biomedical engineering because it combines my love for bith biology and technology. I want to study the principles behind the making of great technological devices, both medical and general devices. To be able to create innovative and distinctive technological devices.
        Thank you.</div>
